# Basic Idea:<br>
I designed a database management system for the Indian Premier League. The main objective of the database is to store and display the statistical data of all the players currently playing for an IPL team and also display the previous season’s match schedule and results. Each user has a unique username and password and a favorite team. In the given project we will be designing a SQL Database which will help the user to analyze the statistics of each player playing for a team in IPL.

# Scope: <br>
We designed a database management system for the Indian Premier League with the goal of displaying the statistical data of all the players currently playing for an IPL team and also to display the previous season’s match schedule and results.

This database should be able to satisfy our user's need of and becomes a benchmark for further improvement/addition. 

The project has scope of adding various other leagues and in-depth statistical parameters.
